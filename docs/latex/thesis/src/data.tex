\subsection{The data}\label{sec:data}
All data provided by the challenge and the opendata.cern dataset \cite{higgsData} was created by the official ATLAS full detector simulator in a two-part process. The simulator first produces proton-proton collisions, called \emph{events}. Then it tracks these via a virtual model of the ATLAS-detector. The resulting data emulates the statistical properties of the real events. By this procedure it is possible to exactly know, if an event is a searched \emph{signal}, or \emph{background}. Signal-events are generated by previously mentioned \emph{tau tau decay of the Higgs Boson} ($\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau $). Background-events originate from three known processes\footnote{These processes are decay of Z bosons, W bosons and pairs of top quarks. There are more processes known that resemble ($\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau $), for simplicity only these three are used as background for this challenge \cite{higgsPaper}.} which produce radiation similar to the signal \cite{higgsPaper}. The feature \texttt{Label} expresses the true class of an event, "$s$" for signals and "$b$" for background.

Every event has a feature \texttt{Weight}, a result of the simulation. The weights correspond to an estimation of the number of expected events of this class in a \emph{region} during a fixed time interval\cite{higgsPaper}.\\
For instance:
A group of 100 events of both classes, "$s$" and "$b$", originates from the region $A$, for which we expect 90\% of events to be background and 10\% being signal.
For another region $B$, we expect a 50/50 distribution. The weight of an event in a region is directly related to the expected probability of its occurrence. This results in a so-called \emph{importance weighting} and causes the mean of the weights for signal-events to be considerably smaller than for background-weights. We will see, that the challenge evaluation utilizes this to punish incorrectly classifying background as signal.

The features \texttt{Weight} and \texttt{Label} were originally only provided in the training dataset. The data used in this thesis is expanded by complete \texttt{Weight}-, \texttt{Label}-features and the Kaggle-specific features \texttt{KaggleSet} and \texttt{KaggleWeight}. The last one is a normalization of \texttt{Weight} for the total number of signal- or background-events with the same \texttt{KaggleSet} feature.
This information enables us to recreate the original datasets using the opendata.cern dataset.

The physical features are separated in two types. Features containing so-called primitive data, properties of events explicitly measured by the simulated ATLAS detector, use the prefix "\texttt{PRI\_}" in their names. The second type is called derived data, which are features that have been computed from primitive features. Their labels use the prefix "\texttt{DER\_}".\\

One might expect decent knowledge in physics as key in succeeding in the challenge. However, the top participants did not use a lot domain knowledge for feature or method selection. One goal of the challenge was to set a task for data scientists without any background in physics \cite{higgsPaper}.

\subsubsection{Data visualization}
To get first information about our data we use basic methods of data analysis.
To evaluate single features for classification we plot a histogram of the class labels' distribution in Fig. \ref{fig:hist1}. A useful way to learn about relations between features is to create \emph{scatter plots} of all two-features combinations, see Fig. \ref{fig:scat1}.
Using these visualizations, we can identify features with good properties for our task.

More details about specific features of the dataset can be found in Appendix \ref{app:data}.
