\section{Understanding the challenge}\label{ch:challenge}

The discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012 received much attention from media all over the world, sometimes being called \emph{the god-particle}. As publicity is a defined goal of the challenge, the good response to its announcement was no surprise.

This chapter presents the key properties of the challenge. In Sect. \ref{sec:data} the data will be described and first methods will be used to gain knowledge about it.
As we continue with sections \ref{sec:prob} and \ref{sec:eval}, we will formulate the classification problem to solve and study the evaluation the challenge uses to rank the participants. We follow the documentation of the challenge\cite{higgsPaper}.
