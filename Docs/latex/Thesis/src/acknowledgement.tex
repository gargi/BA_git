\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Stefan Harmeling. With the deadline approaching, he responded quickly to any questions and gave helpful feedback to several ideas.\\
Assistance provided by Lukas Schoden and Erik Spiegelberg for this work's final formulation was greatly appreciated.

I am thankful to my parents, Christina Janschek and Peter Janschek, for their support and encouragement throughout my study of computer science and physics.

At last I wish to thank Kathrin Dorn as she offered a continues support and endless patience during the last months.
