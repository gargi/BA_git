\section{The detailed description of the features}\label{app:data}

\texttt{This section in its entirety is copied from \cite{higgsPaper}. There are minor changes regarding references in the original document.}

In this section we explain the list of features describing the events.
Prefix-less variables \texttt{EventId}, \texttt{Weight}, \texttt{Label}, \texttt{KaggleSet}, \texttt{KaggleWeight} have a special role and should not be used as input to the classifier. The variables prefixed with \texttt{PRI} (for PRIm-itives) are “raw” quantities about the bunch collision as measured by the detector, essentially the momenta of particles. Variables prefixed with \texttt{DER} (for DERived) are quantities computed from the primitive features. These quantities were selected by the physicists of ATLAS in the reference document [3] either to select regions of interest or as features for the Boosted Decision Trees used in this analysis.
