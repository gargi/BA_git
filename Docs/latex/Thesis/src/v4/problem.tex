We use the formal description of the challenge as it is formulated in \cite{higgsPaper}.\\
Let $D = {(x_i,y_i,w_i)}, \ i \ \epsilon \ [1,n]$ be the training sample with $n$ events, where:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $x_i \ \epsilon \ \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a $d$-dimensional vector
	\item $y_i \ \epsilon$ \{b,s\} is the label
	\item and $w_i \ \epsilon \ \mathbb{R}^{+}$ is a non-negative weight.
\end{itemize}

The sums of signal and background-events

$$S = \sum_{y_i = s} w_i$$ and $$B = \sum_{y_i = b} w_i$$ represent the \textit{expected total number} of signal and background events, during the time of actual data recording.

Let a function $g:  \mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow \{b,s\}$ be a binary classifier, a set $ G_s = \{x : g(x) = s \} $ is called the \textit{selection region}.
Our task is to create $g(x_i)$ while maximizing the Approximate Median Significance (AMS). We shall submit an \textit{index set} 
$ \hat{G}_s = \{i : g(x_i) = s \} $ of points that $g$ classifies as signal and an \textit{index set} $ \hat{G}_b = \{i : g(x_i) \neq s \} $ while $\hat{G}_s \cap \hat{G}_b = \emptyset$.
