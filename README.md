# Classification of Data from the ATLAS experiment

This is the software package created as expansion to the bachelor thesis by Michael Janschek.  
To run most of the code, it is necessary to unpack `data/atlas-higgs-challenge-2014-v2.csv.gz`. 

## Contents
* The thesis in pdf format: [docs/latex/thesis/bin/][1]
* The commented source code: [scripts/python/][2]
* Notebooks as showcases for better understanding of the code: [scripts/python/][3]
 * There are also pdf versions of the notebooks, generated with jupyter's nbconvert tool:[docs/showcases/][3]
* Submission files
